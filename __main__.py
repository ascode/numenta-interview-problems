The engineers at Numenta have invented a simple card game with the following
rules:

Every player is dealt some number of cards.  Each player's hand is scored
according to some simple heuristic.  The winner in each round is determined by
the hand with the highest score.  There can be at most one winner per round.

  Two cards of equal suite comprise a "suited pair"

  not also count as a pair, etc.
